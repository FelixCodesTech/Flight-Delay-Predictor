# Flight-Delay-Predictor
This nice Machine Learning Notebook can predict if your flight is going to delay with something like 60% accuracy ðŸ‘Œ

###### Real Flight with delay from https://www.flightradar24.com/

###### Prediction if the flight is delayed... (without the AI actually knowing that of course)

###### The accuracy of the AI according to the AI...

#### Edit:
##### I saw that some of this readme makes less sense than expected. 
##### â†’ The Flight isn't delayed at arrival, I thought it was when I did the test.
##### â†’ In the output (second screenshot) it says "on the 7 th", of course it doesn't mean the date, <br> it means sunday ("7th day of the week" it was supposed to say)
##### â†’ Thanks for reading ðŸ˜„
